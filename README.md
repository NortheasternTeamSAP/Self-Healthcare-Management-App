Health Springs Application: A Self-health management system

Problem Definition:

An app that helps patients self report their vital signs in today's day and age is desperately needed, as well as providing holistic healing. Integrative medicine is a style of treatment that is focused on the entire patient: their physical, mental, and emotional health. The market for such apps is sadly lacking, yet they are vital for analyzing the health of a patient in general, especially those with a history of disease.
Problem Solution: 

In our study, 83% of people choose holistic healing, so we decided to design an app that combines all the features in one app. In addition to booking an appointment with the doctor, patients can do lab tests on doctors' recommendations. By using our pharmacy, patients can get medicines delivered straight to their homes. Moreover, Dieticians, counsellors as well as fitness trainers are available for appointments. Taking advantage of this solution will contribute to improving a patient's overall quality of life.

Features : 

The application developed by us contains advanced features like :
Amazon S3 Integration 
Email to patients 
Appointment confirmation via text message
Fitness Tracker to help patient monitor their workouts 
Graphs to show various statistics 
Ratings so that patient can view ratings of the doctor before booking appointment 
Excel downloads 


Main Applications used :

Teams for communication among team members 
Twilio for text messaging 
Aws Amazon S3
Jfreechart for graphs
java-mail-1.4.4. for email 
Netbeans for development 
Java swing for UI 
Github for tracking of changes 
DrawIO for sequence diagrams



Conclusion:

The adoption of such holistic healthcare systems will lead to a good demand for apps that can monitor the recovery of patients from every angle, therefore we believe the holistic healthcare system is the future of modern health care. Furthermore, the app can be expanded to include other functions, for example vaccinations. It is our belief that this app will also be adopted by other countries, especially those with large health care sectors such as India and China.
